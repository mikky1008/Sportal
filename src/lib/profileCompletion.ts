// Profile completion: how much of a profile has been filled in with valid information.
//
// This is NOT a performance score. It never reads sessions, rankings or the Athletic Development /
// performance numbers, and nothing that measures performance reads it.
//
// It is also NOT account verification. A coach's `verificationStatus` is never an input here, so a
// coach can be 100% complete while their organization is still pending review.
//
// Nothing is stored: the percentage is always calculated from the saved profile data, so it updates
// the moment a save succeeds and is identical after logging out and back in.
//
// REQUIRED FIELDS (everything else is optional and never counted):
//   Athlete
//     Basic Information (20%)      first name, last name, athletic bio
//     Athletic Information (25%)   sport, position, height, weight, team status
//     School Information (15%)     school, year level
//     Athletic Achievements (10%)  at least one valid achievement
//     Scholarship Interests (10%)  at least one target university, coverage preference, intended course
//     Profile Showcase (20%)       approved profile photo, approved highlight video link
//   optional / not counted: team name, extra achievements, showcase visibility
//   Coach
//     Basic Information (15%)      first name, last name, email
//     Organization (20%)           organization name, type, location
//     Coaching Position (15%)      position, team or program
//     Sport Specialization (15%)   primary sport, competition level
//     Professional Background (15%) years of experience, background summary
//     Verification Information (20%) official email, credential type, credential reference
//   optional / not counted: certifications
